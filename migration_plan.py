COBOL to Spring Boot Migration Task Discovery
Phase 1: Exhaustive task enumeration

Source: og-cics-cobol-app (29 COBOL programs)
Target: target-springboot-cics (Spring Boot + SQLite)

Status Summary:
- 5 programs already migrated (status="completed")
- 9 BMS/UI programs (completed upstream dependencies - REST APIs replace them)
- 15 programs remaining to migrate (status="not-complete")
- 19 total tasks (3 setup + 5 completed migrations + 8 pending migrations + 3 integration)
